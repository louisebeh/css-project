        <div class="description"> Chelsea is an affluent area in central London,[1] bounded to the south by the River Thames. Its frontage runs from Chelsea Bridge along the Chelsea Embankment, Cheyne Walk, Lots Road and Chelsea Harbour. Its eastern boundary was once defined by the River Westbourne, which is now in a pipe above Sloane Square tube station. The modern eastern boundary is Chelsea Bridge Road and the lower half of Sloane Street, including Sloane Square. To the north and northwest, the area fades into Knightsbridge and Brompton, but it is safe to say that the area north of King's Road as far northwest as Fulham Road is part of Chelsea. The football club Chelsea F.C. could reasonably be considered to be based in Chelsea, despite being located in the London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham.</div>
